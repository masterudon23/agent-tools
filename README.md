# agent-tools

I made some tools to improve the agentic development for my current stack. Decided to publish some of them, idk if they're useful to anyone else. 

Use on your own risk. Assume everything in this repo is fully vibe coded.

## Packages

- `convex-vite-plugin` - A Vite plugin for Convex that makes it trivial to setup multiple agents with their isolated environment where they can fuck around without stepping on eachother's toes
- `oxlint-plugin-convex` - An Oxlint plugin to detect unused convex functions since AIs love to leave old code behind

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```
